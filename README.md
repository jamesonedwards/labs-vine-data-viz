==================
This is an experiment designed to explore the boundaries of technology, interfaces and customer experiences. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Vine.

At LABS we had noticed a distinct lack of methods to search through Vine content, other than to use the app itself. LABS undertook the challenge of pulling apart the nuances of the API to see what would be possible and explore new ways of browsing the video content of Vine as well as show new connections between Vines that were not discovered yet. 

The result is a variety of visual explorers for Vine that allow users to delve into the wold of Vine in new ways and immerse the user into 2D and 3D worlds surrounded by the Vine videos all connected along a similar thread.
